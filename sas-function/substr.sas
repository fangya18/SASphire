/*Syntax:
SUBSTR(variable, position, desired length)
Substr extracts a substring from a variable starting at “position” for “desired length” characters.*/

/*Problem:
Now we want to extract the records of variable a that have “.1” as the last two digits. Note the length varies for each record.*/

substr(reverse(strip(visit)), 1 ,2)=”1.”

/*Output:
CYCLE1 DAY 28.1*/

*Alternative Solution;
index(visit,”.”)>0
